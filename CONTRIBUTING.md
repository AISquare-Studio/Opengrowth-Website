## Pull Requests

Pull requests are a great way to get your ideas into our repositories.

When deciding whether to merge a pull request, we look at the following criteria:



### Does it state intent?
You should be clear about which problem you're trying to solve with your contribution.

For example:

Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't tell us anything about why you're doing that.

Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

Tells us the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows us the action you have taken to solve it.



### Is it of good quality?
There are no spelling mistakes.
It reads well.
For English language contributions: Has a good score on Grammarly or Hemingway App.




### Does it move our repository closer to our vision for the organization?
The aim of our repositories is:
- To provide a README.md and assorted documents anyone can copy and paste into their project.
- To ensure the content is usable by someone who hasn't written something like this before.
- To foster a culture of respect and gratitude in the open-source community.




### Does it follow the Contributor Covenant?
Our repositories adhere to a code of conduct. Contributions that do not respect it will be removed.
