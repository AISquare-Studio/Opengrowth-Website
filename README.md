# Project Name

The section after the title is where we say what this library, sample, or SDK does in a few sentences. Consider adding:

- Short description of use case + problem(s) solved.
	- Have you described what it is and what the benefits are in a way a non-developer can understand?
	- If someone Googles to try to learn more about it, is this description easy to find?
	- Is this description easily skimmable? If someone looks at it for 6 seconds can they be convinced?
	- Do you compare your tool to other similar tools so people feel educated about pros/cons of yours?
	- If performance matters, do you have easy-to-skim benchmarks that include comparing it to other tools?
	- Do you have a demo? If it’s open source, are there well documented and easy to build samples/demos?
Have you talked with developers who may be interested to learn about why they haven’t tried it or don’t use it?
- Platform/language version supported
- Links to the project in other repos (npm, packagist, etc)
- Information about maintained and deprecated branches
- Repo status - maintained, deprecated, etc.
